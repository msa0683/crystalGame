# crystalGame

Crystal is an interactive Javascript game. HTML pages are dynamically updated with jQuery.

    - Four crystals are displayed on the page as buttons. 

    - The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

    - When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's         total score. 

    - Player wins if his/her total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

    - Player loses if his/her score goes above the random number.

    - The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.

    - When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals         will have four new hidden values. The user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.

    - The app will show the number of games the player wins and loses.
